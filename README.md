<h1>LPOO Project - G64</h1>
Bullet points for development;

- [ ] UI with different tabs, selectable from keyboard hotkeys -> Architect, Work, Animals, ...
- [ ] Colonists with different attributes that develop as they work
- [ ] Rudimentary building with implementation of cursor (walls and doors)
- [ ] Terrain generation (May be discarded)
- [ ] Raid system, with human raider groups that spawn on edges of map at given encounters and possibly alien raids through drop pods (May be discarded)
- [ ] Combat system (?)
- [ ] Order queue: Colonists each have work and lifestyle priorities that take from the queue of player given commands and routines (essential to maintain the rts feel)
