# LPOO Project - G64

**ASCII Valley** is a simplified text-based adaptation of the indie simulation role-playing video game Stardew Valley with some influences of
 Dwarf Fortress when it comes to the visual details.
 
The player takes on the role of a character who takes charge of his deceased grandfather abandoned farm located in a site named Stardew Valley.
Planting and harvesting crops and fighting off mummies are some of the things that will make you play ASCII Valley for hours on end!

This project was developed by Joao Sousa (up201806613@fe.up.pt) 

and Rafael Ribeiro (up201806330@fe.up.pt)
 
 for LPOO 2019⁄20
